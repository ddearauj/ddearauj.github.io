                         <p>Isella is a dear friend from Singapore whom I met in Japan back in 2019. She visited us (me, Dani, Chomsky and Jorginho) last month here in Amsterdam after her trip to Iceland, and it was wonderful to reunite, catch up on each other's lives and spend time together. Hearing the travel stories and seeing her stunning pictures inspired me to turn her experiences into a blog post and share them with you. So of course, I interviewed her!</p>
<p> <strong>Deve Ser Aqui: Why did you choose this destination?</strong><br> <strong>Isella:</strong> I wanted to go somewhere cold and to be as close to nature as possible. I think it is in a bucketlist of destinations for almost everybody, and since I am 30 I wanted to go on a bigger solo trip, by myself. </p>
<p> <strong>Deve Ser Aqui: What was the most memorable moment in your trip?</strong><br> <strong>Isella:</strong> I think what I didn't expect was to meet nice people. I was alone but went on a tour with other people and ended up making 18 friends, it felt like we were taking care of each other. The group was very diverse, and we got to share amazing moments. For instance, there was a cute elder couple in their 80s and they enjoyed even more than the youngers, they were very adventurous.<br> Because the group became very close, we were having dinner together every night, playing games and going to chase aurora.There was a muslim girl that lives in NY and was very anxious to receive the results of bar exam. At some point of the travel, she got the notice that she was approved and we were all celebrating together.<br> So, scenery is one special thing but people are a huge part of this trip. Nature made me feel very small, the waterfalls, the whales. Normally in Singapore I feel very anxious, chest tightness. But during the trip I was just relaxed.<br> In my daily life I use the smartphone a lot, but this time, in the spare time I was just staring at the window, the landscape is amazing.<br> But answering the question, the most memorable moment for me was the hot bath, when the whole group got closer. We are all together going to the freezing lakes and then to the hot bath. Super fun!<br> The second most memorable moment was seeing the whales. It was amazing to me!<br> </p>
<p> <strong>Deve Ser Aqui: What is your main tip/recommendation for those who are planning to travel to Iceland?</strong><br> <strong>Isella:</strong> Waterproof pants, windbreaker, neckwarmer and hiking boots. The weather is so erratic it changes so quickly, from sunny to windy, and sometimes it is really scary, hurts in the face (feels like microneedling).<br> Apart from that, join all the activities that the tour has to offer!<br> Bring instant noodles and buy alcohol from the airport duty free. Every meal is so expensive there!!! </p>
<p> <strong>Deve Ser Aqui: If you could go back in time, would you do something different. If so, what?</strong><br> <strong>Isella:</strong> No, nothing to regret. </p>
<p> <strong>Extra tips</strong><br><br> <strong>Name of the tour agency:</strong><br> • Troll Expedition <br> • <a href="https://troll.is/iceland-vacation-packages/around-iceland-tours/8-days-ring-road-winter/">8 day tour</a><br> • ps. Please add on all additional activities (all worth it :))<br>

<br>
<strong>Recommendations of restaurants and live bar:</strong><br> • <a href="https://oldiceland.is/">Old Iceland</a> - really yummy food, small and quaint restaurant <br> • <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/bsqBkELK6N4hnZiE9">Sjávargrillið</a> - nice fine dining place for a treat. Price's reasonable & food's good <br>
• <a href="https://g.co/kgs/tpDsgf">Hús máls og menningar</a> - daily live music bar. SO FUN to just sing-along <br> <br>
Sky Lagoon OR Blue Lagoon (thermally-heated pools)<br> Both equally pricey <br> Blue Lagoon - Kinda overrated; with loads of people & water is not that warm. But still feels like the default touristy place to not miss. <br> Sky Lagoon - Pretty at sunset, with full spa experience. But it's a place more for couples. <br>
